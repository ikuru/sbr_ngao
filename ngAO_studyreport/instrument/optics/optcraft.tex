Here we summarize results of studies made by Dr. Yamamuro (Optcraft).
Document Number: CP0046--11--RP001 (w/o FoV split), CP0046--12--RP001 (w
FoV split).

\subsection{Optical Design without FoV Split}

First we studied how wide field of view can be achieved at the
Cassegrain focus of Subaru Telescope with the following conditions:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Single set of optics can be used (i.e., no FoV split is
       considered).
 \item We consider a near-infrared camera and spectrograph. Wavelength
       range is from 0.8$\mu$m to 2.5$\mu$m. The optics will be cooled
       down to about 100K.
 \item The target image quality is to achieve FWHM $<0.15''$ over the
       entire FoV in all of $J$, $H$, $K$-bands.
 \item The focal plane of the instrument should be flat so that we can
       achieve the above image quality by using science detectors with
       flat pixel arrays.
 \item The use of Teledyne H4RG (15$\mu$m pixel size) is assumed.
 \item The sizes of optical components should be feasibile; for example,
       the maximum size of components made of CaF$_2$ and BaF$_2$ should
       be less than 40cm.
\end{itemize}

We examined the two cases on the telescope parameters; (A) the case we
use the existing optical parameters of Subaru Telescope and (B) the case
with new parameters for the secondary mirror and also that the shape of 
primary mirror can be adjusted within the range of the stroke which the
existing mirror actuators are achievable.

Also, we should consider the necessity of field flatner for the
telescope focus. In order to achieve multi-object spectroscopy (MOS), we
need to insert a mask with slitlets at the telescope focus. Since the
Cassegrain focal plane has a curvature, in order to enable the use of
flat MOS mask, we need to insert field flatning lens(es). For the case
A, we show both the case with and without field flatner.

\subsubsection{A. Cases in which Subaru Telescope optical parameters are
   not changed}

Here we show the simplest case where there is no change in the telescope 
parameters and no field flatner is included.
Fig.\ref{fig:optcraft_fig01} is the optical layout. It consists of nine
collimator lenses and seven camera lenses. Lense materials are CaF$_2$, 
BaF$_2$, Fused silica, and ZnSe.The last lens of the camera section is
aspherical. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\caption{Optical layout for Case A: no change in the telescope
 parameters. The case without field flatner.
}
\label{fig:optcraft_fig01}
\end{figure}

The field of view is determined so that the size of effective beam for
the largest lens is within $\phi$400mm, and in this solution it is 
$\phi 13.2'$. The effective diameter of the primary mirror is 
$\phi 7.88$m to achieve the above FoV at the secondary mirror pupil and
to block the light outside of the primary mirror (physical size 
$\phi$8.2m). Since this layout does not include field flatner, the
telescope focal plane has a curvature, and there is astigmatism.

The spot diagram at the position of the MOS mask (with a radius of
curvature of 2417.3mm) is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:optcraft_fig02}(left). The degradation of the image toward
the edge of FoV ($\sim 0.2''$ at the edge) is due to astigmatism. 
In this case the slit width at the edge should be adjusted to this image
quality. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:optcraft_fig02}(right) shows the size of distortion at the
position of the MOS mask.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

 curvature radius of 2417.3mm for a configuration shown in

 0.8$\mu$m to 2.5$\mu$m are shown altogether, as wavelength dependence
 is small. (Right) distortion at the
 position of the MOS mask. The value is $-0.04$\% at the edge.
}
\label{fig:optcraft_fig02}
\end{figure}

The spot diagram and distortion at the position of the detectors are
shown in Fig. \ref{fig:optcraft_fig04}. All FWHM values are smaller than
the target FWHM (0.15$''$) except the case with 0.8$\mu$m
at the edge ($6.6'$) in which the FWHM is slightly larger than
0.15$''$. However, the distortion is large; at the edge it is 
$-6.3$\%.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

 2.5$\mu$m are plotted along the horizontal axis. 
The box size is 100$\mu$m which corresponds to 0.53$''$.

\end{figure}


We also evaluated the performance in spectroscopy. As a preliminary
analysis, here we only examined the image quality in spectroscopy in the
range 0.8--2.5$\mu$m without order-sorting.
Fig.~\ref{fig:optcraft_fig06} shows the positions of images in
spectroscopy as a function of wavelength.
Here we assume a fused silica grism with 160 grooves/mm, blaze angle 
34$\circ$\footnote{In section ** we examine more details of various
grisms}.
Fig.~\ref{fig:optcraft_fig07} is the spot diagram. Image qualities at
the shorter and longer wavelength edges and at the edge of FoV is not
good; in 2.5$\mu$m and at $6.6'$ from the center the RMS spot diameter
is $0.22''$. However, it is $0.17''$ at $5.5'$ from the center, and
at the other positions the image quality meets the goal.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\includegraphics[width=120mm]{\thisdir figs/optcraft_fig07.eps}
}
\caption{Spot diagram for spectroscopy with a configuration shown in
 Fig.~\ref{fig:optcraft_fig01}.}
\label{fig:optcraft_fig07}
\end{figure}

Next we examined the case where there is no change in the telescope
parameters again, and a field flatner which consists of two lenses. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:optcraft_fig08} shows the optical layout of the case.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=120mm]{\thisdir figs/optcraft_fig08.eps}
}
\caption{Optical layout for Case A: no change in the telescope
 parameters. The case with field flatner.
}
\label{fig:optcraft_fig08}
\end{figure}

The optical design was made so that the effective diameter of the
largest lens is no larger than $\phi$400mm, as it is in the case without
the flatner. The field of view is $\phi 12.6'$, which is slightly
smaller than the case without the flatner, because the field flatner
acts like a concave lens and we need collimator lenses larger than the
flatner. The effective diameter of the primary mirror to block the light
outside of the primary mirror is $\phi$7.92m.
In addition to make the telescope focal plane flat, the addition of the
flatner enables a correction of astigmatism. As shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:optcraft_fig09}, the image quality is good at the flat MOS
mask, and there is no chromatic abberation.
We should note that there is distortion, which amounts +0.73\% at the
edge of the FoV.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=100mm]{\thisdir figs/optcraft_fig09.eps}
 \includegraphics[width=60mm]{\thisdir figs/optcraft_fig10.eps}
}
\caption{(Left) Spot diagram at the MOS mask plate.
(Right) distortion at the MOS mask plate.
}
\label{fig:optcraft_fig09}
\end{figure}

For the image quality at the position of the detectors, similar to the
case without the flatner, in the most of the FoV and for the most of the
wavelength range the image quality satisfies the goal (FWHM smaller than
approx. $0.15''$), while in a few cases (such at the FoV edge ($6.3'$
from the center) and with 0.8$\mu$m) the image quality is slightly worse
than the goal. Distortion is large; it is $-5.2$\% at the edge of FoV.
Performance in the spectroscopy is also similar to the case without the
flatner, and in most cases the qulality satisfies the goal.
We should note that with the field flatner the optical layout is not
telecentric, and the plate scale should be changed if there is a focus
offset.  So the focusing is more important in this case.




\subsubsection{B. Cases in which Subaru Telescope optical parameters are
   changed}

Next we examined the case in which Subaru Telescope's optical parameters
are changed. In order to make the telescope's F number smaller, the
primary mirror's aspheric parameters should be negative. The actuator
storoke for the primary mirror is guaranteed up to 12$\mu$m. We assume
the conic parameters so that displacement at the edge of the primary
mirror is 12$\mu$m, and set F number to be 9.8.

The parameters of the secondary mirror is determined as it is optimal
for this Cassegrain wide-field instrument, and it is independent from
the existing secondary mirrors of Subaru Telescope.
It is a bipolar mirror with a diameter of $\phi$1544mm. The radius of
curvature is 7233.308mm and the conic constant is $-2.35464$.
The field of view is determined by the effective maximum size of the
lens ($\phi$400mm), and it is $\phi16.2'$.
Thanks to the smaller F number, the field of view is 28\% larger than
the case without changing the telescope parameters. The effective
diameter of the primary mirror to avoid the beam outside of the
secondary pupil and primary mirror ($\phi$8.2m) is $\phi$7.93m.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=120mm]{\thisdir figs/optcraft_fig15.eps}
}
\caption{The optical layout of the case B: Subaru Telescope
 optical parameters are modified. A field flatner is included in this
 design. 
}
\label{fig:optcraft_fig15}
\end{figure}

In this design a set of lenses as a field flatner is included. 
The spot diagram at the flat MOS mask position is presented in 
Fig. \ref{fig:optcraft_fig16}.
Although small coma aberration is present, its effect is small. There is
no chromatic aberration, overall image quality is good, although there
is distortion aberration at the edge of the FoV.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=100mm]{\thisdir figs/optcraft_fig16.eps}
\includegraphics[width=60mm]{\thisdir figs/optcraft_fig17.eps}
}
\caption{(Left) Spot diagram at the MOS mask position.
(Right) distortion aberration at the MOS mask position.
}
\label{fig:optcraft_fig16}
\end{figure}

The configuration of optics after MOS position is similar to the case
without change of the telescope parameters: collimator with nine lenses
and camera with seven lenses. The focal plane is flat. The optical
layout in shown in Fig.\ref{fig:optcraft_fig15}.

In Fig. \ref{fig:optcraft_fig18} we show the spot diagram and distortion
aberration at the position of detectors.
Image quality at outskirt of the FoV ($>6'$) in a short wavelength
(0.8--0.9$\mu$m) degrades by $\sim0.2''$. Otherwise image quality
satisfies the goal (FWHM$\sim 0.15''$).
The maximum distortion aberration at the edge of FoV is $-1.24$\%, which
is smaller than the cases without changes in telescope parameters.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\includegraphics[width=120mm]{\thisdir figs/optcraft_fig18.eps}

}
\caption{(Left) Spot diagram at the positions of the detectors.
Images with five positions within the FoV (vertical) and seven
 wavelengths from 0.8$\mu$m to 2.5$\mu$m (horizontal) are plotted.
The box size is 100$\mu$m, which corresponds to $0.59''$.
The RMS spot diameters are $0.2''$ (at $8.1'$, $0.8\mu$m), 
$0.16''$ (at $6'$, $0.8\mu$m), $0.19''$ (at $6'$, $0.9\mu$m), and for
 other positions and wavelength the spot diameters are within $0.15''$.
(Right) Distortion aberration. It reaches to $-1.24$\% at the edge of

\end{figure}

Performance in spectroscopy mode is examined and is reported in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:optcraft_fig20}. Here a grism made of fused silica, 160
lines/mm, blaze angle 35$^\circ$ is assumed, and the sizes of spectra on
the detector is presented.

In regards to the image quality, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:optcraft_fig21}, in some cases at the edge of FoV or
shortest/longest wavelengths the RMS spot diameter becomes as large as 
$0.23''$. Otherwise the image quality satisfies the goal, especially
within $6'$ from the center of FoV.

\caption{Spot diagram for Case B, spectroscopy mode.
In shorter wavelength the performance is somewhat worse than the goal;
 at 0.8$\mu$m RMS spot diameters are in general 0.17--0.18$''$, and 
 0.2$''$ at 0.9$\mu$m. In longer wavelength spot diameter becomes larger
 at positions with distance from the center larger than $6'$ with
 $\lambda = 2.3-2.5\mu$m. Otherwise the image quality satisfies the goal
 ($0.15''$).
