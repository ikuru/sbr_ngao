\section{Requirements on Instrument from Scientific Objectives}

Here we re-summarize the requirements from key science cases on
instrument specifications.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Field of view
 \item Pixel scale
 \item Requirements on broad-band filters (numbers, wavelength coverages)
 \item Requirements on narrow-band filters (numbers, spectral resolution,
      wavelength uniformity, wavelength coverages)
 \item Spectroscopy: Spectral resolution 
 \item Requirements on multi-object spectrograph mode
\end{itemize}

In this chapter we summarize the studies we have made so far on
instruments for ULTIMATE-SUBARU.
