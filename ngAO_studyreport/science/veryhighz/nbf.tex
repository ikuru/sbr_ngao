\subsection{Introduction}

Subaru has been one of leading facilities pushing the frontier of
the distant universe. A unique capability of the prime focus camera
(Suprime-Cam) have enabled us to conduct wide-field survey which is
essentially important to find very rare objects such as luminous distant
galaxies. One of the efficient methods to find distant star-forming
galaxies is to detect Ly$\alpha$ emission using narrow-band filter
imaging. 


Currently a new prime focus camera in optical wavelength,
Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), is under testing. HSC has more than seven times
wider field-of-view, and it is expected to enable us conducting deep
surveys much more efficiently than the current Suprime-Cam.
However, the wavelength of the redshifted Ly$\alpha$
