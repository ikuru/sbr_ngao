\subsection{Introduction}

Subaru has been one of leading facilities pushing the frontier of
the distant universe. A unique capability of the prime focus camera
(Suprime-Cam) have enabled us to conduct wide-field survey which is
essentially important to find very rare objects such as luminous distant
galaxies. One of the efficient methods to find distant star-forming
galaxies is to detect Ly$\alpha$ emission using narrow-band filter (NBF) 
imaging. A strongly star-forming object with a redshift 
$z = \lambda_\mathrm{NBF} / \lambda_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} -1$ could
appear to be bright compared to those with adjacent broad-band
filters. Galaxies detected with this methods are called as 'Ly$\alpha$
emitters (or LAEs)'. The current most distant galaxy with a spectroscopic 
confirmation is an LAE at $z=7.215$, which was discovered by
\citet{Shibuya2012} using Suprime-Cam with a narrow-band filter NB1006
(central $\lambda$ is 10,052\AA).

Currently a new prime focus camera for Subaru Telescope in optical
wavelength, Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), is under testing. HSC has more than
seven times wider field-of-view, and it is expected to enable us
conducting deep surveys much more efficiently than the current
Suprime-Cam. HSC will have a NBF called NB101 which has a central
$\lambda$ is 10,095\AA, which will be used to detect many $z\sim 7.3$
LAEs. 
However, the wavelength of the redshifted Ly$\alpha$ is almost at the
long wavelength limit of the CCDs, and finding galaxies at $z>7.5$ with
cameras with CCDs is impossible. So deep near-IR surveys are mandatory
to push the redshift frontier further.

\subsection{Surveys with ULTIMATE-SUBARU}

We will use special narrow-band filters which are designed to trace
photons with wavelength ranges between the strong OH air glows from the
Earth's atmosphere.
Here we assume three wavelength ranges as a fiducial set to study the
feasibility.

\begin{table}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rrr}
\hline
$\lambda_\mathrm{c}$ & FWHM & $z_{\mathrm Ly\alpha}$\\
\hline
1.0625 & 0.015  &  7.74\\
1.340  & 0.019  & 10.0 \\
1.550  & 0.022  & 11.75\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Central wavelengths ($\lambda_\mathrm{c}$ in $\mu$m), FWHM (in $\mu$m),
 and redshifts of Ly$\alpha$ emission at $\lambda_\mathrm{c}$ for NBFs
 considered here.
